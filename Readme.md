# Idea Miner

This is a React Native project built with Expo. It uses Supabase for its backend, React Navigation for navigation, and React Native Paper for UI components.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `app/`: Contains the core application logic, with subdirectories for `assets`, `components`, `constants`, `context`, `hooks`, `lib`, `navigation`, `screens`, `services`, `store`, and `utils`.
- `node_modules/`: Contains all the project dependencies.
- `package.json`: Defines the project's metadata, scripts, and dependencies.
- `App.js`: The main entry point of the application.
- `index.js`: The entry point for React Native.
- `.env`: Environment variables.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have Node.js and Expo CLI installed on your machine. Then, you can run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the development server and you can run the app on your phone using the Expo Go app.
